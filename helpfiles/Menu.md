### Selecting plots

***

This tool allows you to plot three different types of plots: scatterplot, barchart and heatmap. After selecting a desired plot type, the menu for it will pop out. Then you need to select variables which describe each of dimentions of your data an click "Generate plot". Chart is dynamic, so after first generation, further changes in variables will adjust plot dynamically. <br>
You can plot more than one chart in one session. To do that, you need to select from one to three plot types. After generating a plot, it stays in memory, so you can unselect it and after next selection, same plot will be drawn.
